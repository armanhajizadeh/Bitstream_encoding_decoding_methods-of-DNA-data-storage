# Bitstream_encoding_decoding_methods-of-DNA-data-storage


Can we retrieve data without any sequencing and with just multiplexed PCR? 
 
The original image is from Maryam Mirzakhani's childhood. The renowned Iranian mathematician studied at Sharif University of Technology and earned her Ph.D. at Harvard University. She was awarded the Fields Medal in 2014 for her outstanding contributions to geometry and passed away in 2017 due to breast cancer.

You can access the programming I shared in this repository if you like.
In the next step, I would like to try CNN Image Retrieval in PyTorch for training and evaluating CNNs for Image Retrieval in PyTorch, inspired by Filip Radenovic
working at MetaAI.
